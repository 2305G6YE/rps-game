<h1> Rock Paper Scissors</h1>

<h3> Overview</h3>
<p> This is a project undertaken as part of the Foundational Javascript section in TOP (The Odin Project). The objective is
to create a workable rock-paper-scissors game that you can attempt with on the console in Chrome Dev Tools.</p>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p> It has been awhile since I had to use the VSC editor ever since I started learning Javascript. It also provided a nice contrast to the C++ 
I was learning in CS50. I had a lot of opportunities to compare syntax differences in functions and loops. This game would provide a good confidence boost to my general javascript basics.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<p>Compared to my first problem set in cs50, i was a lot more methodical in breaking down the initial problem into pseudocode, making sure to adhere to the contraints set by project's requirements. I want to thank CS50 for providing a starting reference point in my head for algorithmic thinking in general. The biggest problems I had during this project was not the thinking process nor the coding, but the debugging. I think I learnt that debugging in general shows me where my logic or understanding is flawed. After all, what a computer outputs is not wrong, I am just sending the wrong commands to it. This time it was about equal signs and strict equality. I have to make sure I know what type of values I put inside my function's parenthesis, otherwise a singular equal sign would trigger all instances instead of the conditions I desire. 

The only thing I desire out of this to learn more about is resetting counters back to 0 after every concluded game. In other words, learning more deeply about scope, hoisting and such. As of now the rock-paper-scissors game works fine, but the 2nd full game onwards the counter begins from the previous one instead of a clean slate.  <p>
