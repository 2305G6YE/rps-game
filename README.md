# Rock Paper Scissors

## Overview  (14th May 2025)
This is a project undertaken as part of the [Foundational Javascript section in TOP (The Odin Project)](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors). The objective is to create a workable rock-paper-scissors game that you can attempt with on the console in Chrome Dev Tools.


## Objective (14th May 2025)
It has been awhile since I had to use the VSC editor ever since I started learning Javascript. It also provided a nice contrast to the C++ 
I was learning in CS50. I had a lot of opportunities to compare syntax differences in functions and loops. This game would provide a good confidence boost to my general javascript basics.


## Takeaways (14th May 2025)
Compared to my first problem set in cs50, i was a lot more methodical in breaking down the initial problem into pseudocode, making sure to adhere to the contraints set by project's requirements. I want to thank CS50 for providing a starting reference point in my head for algorithmic thinking in general. The biggest problems I had during this project was not the thinking process nor the coding, but the debugging. I think I learnt that debugging in general shows me where my logic or understanding is flawed. After all, what a computer outputs is not wrong, I am just sending the wrong commands to it. This time it was about equal signs and strict equality. I have to make sure I know what type of values I put inside my function's parenthesis, otherwise a singular equal sign would trigger all instances instead of the conditions I desire. 

The only thing I desire out of this to learn more about is resetting counters back to 0 after every concluded game. In other words, learning more deeply about scope, hoisting and such. As of now the rock-paper-scissors game works fine, but the 2nd full game onwards the counter begins from the previous one instead of a clean slate.

## Coming back after learning DOM Manipulation (9th June 2025)
Newly Learnt: `z-index` `<video` `rgba`  
Most Helpful: `===` `document.getElementById`

I was tasked to remake this project by asking the player to input their choices in the game using buttons that are interactable on the webpage. I further gave the project a bit of an extra spin (because I like doing such things) by adding in addition to the minimum requirements of displaying the final round winner and running score:

* Revised flexbox elements to center the UI
* A altered opacity footer that displays the scores 
* A video background referenced from [Chandresh Uike](https://www.pexels.com/video/dynamic-abstract-wavy-line-background-animation-32399170/)

While I had relatively no problems with reformatting the code, I was particularly stuck on debugging because I incorrectly wrote a equality operator (`==` `===`) as a assignment operator (`=`). That small blunder cost me quite awhile. So that would be the biggest takeaway from this project. 

In the future, now that I went back and did a little bit of css and flexbox revision, I would like to add a search bar feature or something along those likes that forces me to use arrays. That would be a good way to get revision in that area in. I also want to experiment with further css properties and slowly expand my knowledge in those. Examples of above include: 

* `map` `filter` `remove`
* `flex-basis`
* `transition`
* `text-shadow`

最初始めてから複雑変更が実施しがちですが、ズルズル追加なら絶対に上手になると思います。でも私の色のセンスがちょっと古っぽいインタネットのスタイルでしょう。他のウェブサイトをちゃんと見ればもっと多く参考が使える。
